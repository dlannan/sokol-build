# Sokol

# NOTICE
The fork here is specifically to support two main activities:
1. Be able to automate the building of sokol shared libraries for multiple platforms
2. To generate luajit ffi files for use with Thunc (A game engine under construction).

The source code will be regularly sync'd with the original codebase and the shared lib source files may be irregularly updated.
This SHOULD NOT be considered a pristine fork of sokol. Please visit the original page for that (as well as documentation and so on).

We appreicate the amazing work gone into sokol and hope contribute some code back with modules, and bindings (for luajit).
